# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to participate and solve the puzzles.

Currently, I am attempting the challenge with Python. I may add solutions in other languages in the future. :D\
In addition to each day's solution, a benchmark script is also included in the same folder to measure the average runtime of the solution.

## Progress

| Year | Day             | Title                                              | Part | Language    | Time (s) | Solution                      |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2023 | [1](./day_one/) | [Trebuchet?!](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1) | 1    | Python 3.12 | 0.000471 | [Here](./day_one/part_one.py) |

> The execution time is an average of 10 runs and is measured using the _timeit_ library in Python 3.12.
