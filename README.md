# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to participate and solve the puzzles.

Currently, I am attempting the challenge with Python. I may add solutions in other languages in the future. :D\
In addition to each day's solution, a benchmark script is also included in the same folder to measure the average runtime of the solution.

## Progress
